This repository is a collection of random useful things for LeRobot, LeKiwi, and SO-ARM100/101. I experiment with these robots and library a lot and will share some useful pieces of code or stl models here.


# Code 

TBD

# 3D models

[`servo_wheel_hub.stl`](stl/servo_wheel_hub.stl): is a slightly modified version of the [original LeKiwi wheel hub](https://github.com/SIGRobotics-UIUC/LeKiwi/blob/main/3DPrintMeshes/servo_wheel_hub.stl). I altered it so it is possible to use the screws included into the servo motors and omni wheels. I used [these wheels](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/14049-Zoty-100mm-Omnidirectional-Wheel-Omni_62514267136.html) - that is one of the recommended models.

`camera_mount_n.stl` [[1](stl/camera_mount_1.stl), [2](stl/camera_mount_2.stl), [3](stl/camera_mount_3.stl)] - different mounts for [this camera](https://s.lazada.co.th/s.viOCK). I use it with custom gripper, not all of them will work with the original so-100.
